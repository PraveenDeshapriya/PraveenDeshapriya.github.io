    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>3½ cups rice flour</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
	<li>2 (13.5 oz.) cans coconut milk</li>
	<li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: Combine the yeast and water in a glass and set aside for about 10 minutes until it gets foamy.</li>
        <li>Step 2: Combine salt, rice flour, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer.Add the yeast mixture and stir until obtaining a homogeneous batter.Cover, and set aside for at least 2 hours, in a warm place.</li>
	<li>Step 3: Add the coconut milk and baking soda and mix until smooth.Cover and set aside for another hour.</li>
	<li>Step 4: Batter should have the consistency of a thin crepe batter. If it is too thick, adjust by adding water or coconut milk.</li>
	<li>Step 5: If using a non-stick hopper pan, slightly wipe the pan with a paper towel soaked in vegetable oil. If using a more traditional iron hopper pan, grease with a little more oil.</li>
	<li>Step 6: Heat the hopper pan over a high heat, then lower to medium.</li>
	<li>Step 7: Add a ladle of hopper batter and immediately swirl the batter around the pan to cover the entire surface.</li>
	<li>Step 8: Add an egg in the center of the hopper to make an egg hopper (optional).</li>
	<li>Step 9: Cover and cook until the batter sets, the edges are crispy (and the egg white has set), about 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
	<li>Step 10: Gently slide the hopper out of the pan to a plate.</li>
