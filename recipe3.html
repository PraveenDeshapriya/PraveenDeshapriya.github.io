    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups whole wheat flour (+ ⅓ cup for kneading and forming the breads)</li>
        <li>¾ cup water (or more)</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>3½ cups rice flour</li>
	<li>4 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter), melted</li>
	
    </ul>
    <h3>Equipments:</h3>
    <ul>
	<li>Stand mixer</li>
	<li>1 chakla</li>
	<li>1 belan (thin rolling pin)</li>
	<li>1 pair of chimta (tongs)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1: In the bowl of a stand mixer combine the 2 cups (250 g) of flour, salt and 1 tablespoon of ghee.</li>
	<li>Step 2: Using the dough hook, while kneading at medium speed, gradually incorporate the water until obtaining a soft and elastic dough. It is also possible to use a bread maker or knead by hand. The amount of water to incorporate varies depending on the quality of the whole wheat flour.</li>
	<li>Step 3: Place the dough on a floured work surface and mill it.Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes. This will help the gluten to be released and the dough will become more elastic.</li>
	<li>Step 4: At the end of 30 minutes, uncover the dough and knead it again, milling it with lightly oiled hands.</li>
	<li>Step 5: Pour the remaining ghee in one bowl and the remaining flour in another bowl.Lightly flour a chakla or a work surface.Divide the dough into 12 pieces of equal weight.</li>
	<li>Step 6: Using a belan or a thin rolling pin, roll each ball into a patty about ⅛ inch (2-3 mm) thick and 3 to 4 inches (12 to 15 cm) in diameter.</li>
	<li>Step 7: Preheat a tawa, skillet or griddle over medium-high heat.Take the roti and turn it between the two palms to remove all traces of flour. Transfer the roti to the tawa.</li>
	<li>Step 8: Flip the roti when the color begins to change and small air pockets form in about 5 to 10 seconds.</li>
	<li>Step 9: For the other side, bake it directly over the flame using a pair of chimta or metal tongs, until there are brown spots on the roti.</li>
	<li>Step 10: Place the roti on a baking sheet, brush it with a little melted ghee and, using metal tongs, grill them for a few seconds over a flame on both sides. If there is no direct flame, cook on the tawa for both sides.</li>
	<li>Step 11: Repeat the process until all the balls of dough are used up.</li>
	<li>Step 12: Enjoy the hot roti with any curry, dal, or vegetables.</li>
